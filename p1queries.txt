We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The
following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children,
Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.*/

/*Question 2 Set 1
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly
movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide
a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter,
second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles
(25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make
sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

/*Question 3 Set 1
Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the
quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film
category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table
should have three columns:

Category
Rental length category
Count*/

We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders
during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that
returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental
orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a
column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental
orders fulfilled during that month.*/
